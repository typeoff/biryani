Biryani
================================

Biryani is a libre font development project. Currently, support for the Devangari and Latin scripts is offered. The design takes the form of a geometric, monolinear sans. Both the Devanagari and Latin character sets are oiginal work developed by Dan Reynolds and Mathieu Réguer.

The Biryani typeface falls more along the display spectrum. It is not quite a design intended for the setting of text meant for immersive reading. In addition to Western and Central European languages, Biryani may be be  to set text in languages written in the Devanagari script, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Sanskrit, etc. 

Two folders are hosted here: <em>Font Files</em> and <em>Source Files</em>. The font files folder contain both PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts (.otf) and TrueType-flavored fonts (.ttf). The .ttf-files are auto-hinted with ttfautohint version 1.3. All of the font files will be generated with the Glyphs 2 (beta version) font editing application. The source files folder contain a native Glyphs file as well as UFOs exported from Glyphs.

Biryani’s working name was Devanagari Three. All files are offered as-is.
